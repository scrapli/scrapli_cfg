Scrapli Config async base class Args: conn: scrapli connection to use config_sources: list of config sources on_prepare: optional callable to run at connection `prepare` dedicated_connection: if `False` (default value) scrapli cfg will not open or close the underlying scrapli connection and will raise an exception if the scrapli connection is not open. If `True` will automatically open and close the scrapli connection when using with a context manager, `prepare` will open the scrapli connection (if not already open), and `close` will close the scrapli connection. ignore_version: ignore checking device version support; currently this just means that scrapli-cfg will not fetch the device version during the prepare phase, however this will (hopefully) be used in the future to limit what methods can be used against a target device. For example, for EOS devices we need > 4.14 to load configs; so if a device is encountered at 4.13 the version check would raise an exception rather than just failing in a potentially awkward fashion.

You can create your connection object directly from the appropriate scrapli_cfg class, i.e., ScrapliCfgIOSXE , or you can use the \"factory\" function to appropriately dispatch the class type based on a provided conn object (scrapli connection object). A simple example of creating a scrapli_cfg object by both methods is below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg.platform.core.cisco_iosxe import ScrapliCfgIOSXE from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.11\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"cisco_iosxe\" } conn = Scrapli ( ** device ) cfg_conn_from_specific_platform_class = ScrapliCfgIOSXE ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn_from_factory = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) The available platform names are: arista_eos cisco_iosxe cisco_iosxr cisco_nxos juniper_junos Driver Arguments \u00b6 scrapli_cfg doesn't have a ton of arguments/options that you need to worry about! The most important argument is the conn argument -- which is expecting a scrapli connection that is built from the NetworkDriver . This connection must be from one of the \"core\" scrapli platforms (EOS, IOSXE, IOSXR, NXOS, JunOS). The other remaining primary arguments are as follows: config_sources : Generally ignored/handled by the platform implementation for you. A list of strings representing the valid config sources, i.e. \"running\", \"candidate\", or \"startup\" on_prepare : A callable (sync or async depending on your code of course) that is executed during the prepare method; initially scrapli-cfg contained a default callable that would disable console logging (in most cases), however as this actually made changes to your device that were somewhat \"magic\" it was removed. Now, users can pass an on_prepare callable to disable console logging, or really anything else they want. This callable should accept cls as the first argument which is a reference to the scrapli-cfg object itself (and thus has access to the underlying scrapli connection). More on this in the on_prepare section . dedicated_connection : If False (default value) scrapli cfg will not open or close the underlying scrapli connection and will raise an exception if the scrapli connection is not open. If True will automatically open and close the scrapli connection when using with a context manager, prepare will open the scrapli connection (if not already open), and close will close the scrapli connection. ignore_version : Ignore checking device version support; currently this just means that scrapli-cfg will not fetch the device version during the prepare phase, however this will (hopefully) be used in the future to limit what methods can be used against a target device. For example, for EOS devices we need > 4.14 to load configs; so if a device is encountered at 4.13 the version check would raise an exception rather than just failing in a potentially awkward fashion. There are no additional arguments for creating a scrapli_cfg object, though each platform may have other optional arguments as necessary -- check the docs/class for those. scrapli_cfg Methods \u00b6 scrapli_cfg methods are mostly intended at managing device configuration, though there are a few extra methods in there as well. The following sections provide a brief description and example of how to use the main public methods. Note that nearly all public methods in scrapli_cfg will return a ScrapliCfgResponse object that will contain a result attribute of the result of the given task, as well as the underlying scrapli Response object, and the usual scrapli attributes like start/finish/elapsed time, a failed attribute, and a raise_for_status method. Get Version \u00b6 The get_version method does exactly what you would expect it to -- it fetches the version string from the target device. scrapli_cfg very intentionally has no \"getters\" (in the NAPALM-sense) except for get_version and get_config -- this is because there is no desire to maintain support for getters across a huge variety of versions/platforms. That said, the get_version method was implemented in order to (obviously) fetch device versions to (in the future) be used to validate the target device version supports all features that scrapli_cfg needs in order to manage the configurations. A simple example of fetching and printing the device version: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.11\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"cisco_iosxe\" } with Scrapli ( ** device ) as conn : cfg_conn = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn . prepare () version_result = cfg_conn . get_version () print ( version_result . result ) Get Config \u00b6 The get_config method does exactly what you would think it does, it fetches the device configuration as a string. This method supports a source argument to which you can provide a string representing the source config you would like to get -- generally this will be either \"startup\" or \"running\". A simple example of fetching and printing the device startup configuration: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.11\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"cisco_iosxe\" } with Scrapli ( ** device ) as conn : cfg_conn = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn . prepare () cfg_result = cfg_conn . get_config ( source = \"startup\" ) print ( cfg_result . result ) Get Checkpoint (NXOS Only) \u00b6 NXOS can be a little... difficult with configuration replacement operations. It expects to be fed \"checkpoint\" files instead of \"normal\" configuration text. In order to make life a bit easier the NXOS platform supports a get_checkpoint method that fetches a checkpoint file from the device. This is basically the same overall behavior as get_config , just resulting in fetching a checkpoint file. Some details about checkpoints can be found here . A simple example of fetching and printing a checkpoint file from an NXOS device: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.12\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"cisco_nxos\" } with Scrapli ( ** device ) as conn : cfg_conn = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn . prepare () chkpoint_result = cfg_conn . get_checkpoint () print ( chkpoint_result . result ) Load Config \u00b6 Another, hopefully very obviously named method! load_config does what it sounds like. load_config accepts a configuration to load (as a string; note that if you are doing config replace with NXOS you should use a checkpoint file!), optionally a bool indicating if the operation is a \"replace\" operation (default is False it is a merge operation), and lastly some optional keyword arguments that vary from platform to platform. If replace is False (default) then the config will be loaded as a merge candidate, otherwise it will be loaded as a full replace candidate. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg with open ( \"config\" , \"r\" ) as f : my_config = f . read () device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.11\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"cisco_iosxe\" } with Scrapli ( ** device ) as conn : cfg_conn = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn . prepare () load_result = cfg_conn . load_config ( config = my_config , replace = True ) print ( load_result ) Note that loading a configuration does not apply the configuration! This simply will create a configuration session or a file on the device (depending on the specific platform type) that can be used to merge/replace the config. Abort Config \u00b6 If you've loaded a configuration but don't want to commit it, you can call abort_config which will delete the candidate config/delete config sessions used to load the config. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg with open ( \"config\" , \"r\" ) as f : my_config = f . read () device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.11\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"cisco_iosxe\" } with Scrapli ( ** device ) as conn : cfg_conn = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn . prepare () load_result = cfg_conn . load_config ( config = my_config , replace = True ) print ( load_result ) abort_result = cfg_conn . abort_config () print ( abort_result ) Commit Config \u00b6 If you've loaded a config and want to save/commit it you can do so with the commit_config method: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg with open ( \"config\" , \"r\" ) as f : my_config = f . read () device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.11\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"cisco_iosxe\" } with Scrapli ( ** device ) as conn : cfg_conn = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn . prepare () load_result = cfg_conn . load_config ( config = my_config , replace = True ) print ( load_result ) commit_result = cfg_conn . commit_config () print ( commit_result ) Diff Config \u00b6 Perhaps the most interesting/handy method of all: diff_config ! Just like the other methods, this method does exactly what it sounds like it would. There is one important difference between this method and the others, however; the diff_config method returns a ScrapliCfgDiffResponse object instead of a ScrapliCfgResponse object. The ScrapliCfgDiffResponse object is mostly the same as a normal scrapli_cfg response, but it also contains some properties that contain the diff output. scrapli_cfg always tries to get a diff from the device itself -- from whatever means are available on box, but also builds some basic diffs of its own. The diffs that scrapli_cfg builds are fairly simple and will show the difference between the candidate config and the target config, but will have no context about merge vs replace operations, so the diff will always show the \"full\" configuration diff (with colorful output though!). You can see each of the diffs like so: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg with open ( \"config\" , \"r\" ) as f : my_config = f . read () device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.11\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"cisco_iosxe\" } with Scrapli ( ** device ) as conn : cfg_conn = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn . prepare () load_result = cfg_conn . load_config ( config = my_config , replace = True ) print ( load_result ) diff_result = cfg_conn . diff_config () print ( diff_result . device_diff ) print ( diff_result . unified_diff ) print ( diff_result . side_by_side_diff ) Render Substituted Config \u00b6 The render_substituted_config method is used to (based on user provided regex) auto merge a candidate configuration with sections of the current device configuration. This is meant to allow users an easy-ish way to start doing config replace operations, without having to have a template that covers all aspects of the device configuration. For example, let's say you want to manage everything on a switch except the interfaces. Maybe you want to do this because managing loads of templates for all the different types of interfaces/platforms is a pain, or maybe a different team manages that part of the config... whatever the case you want to be able to do full config replaces, but leave that part of the config completely untouched. This is what the render_substitued_config method is designed to help you with. Here is an example of using this method: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg from scrapli_cfg.platform.core.arista_eos.patterns import ETHERNET_INTERFACES with open ( \"config\" , \"r\" ) as f : my_config = f . read () device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.14\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"arista_eos\" } with Scrapli ( ** device ) as conn : cfg_conn = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn . prepare () rendered_config = cfg_conn . render_substituted_config ( config_template = my_config , substitutes = [( \"ethernet_interfaces\" , ETHERNET_INTERFACES )] ) load_result = cfg_conn . load_config ( config = my_config , replace = True ) print ( load_result ) In the above example we have a fairly \"normal\" scrapli_cfg setup -- create a connection and open it. Once the connection is opened we call the render_substituted_config and we pass a config_template and a list of substitutes to it. The config template is what it sounds like -- a template (that looks like a jinja2 template). In this case, this template has a variable ethernet_interfaces in the file where the ethernet interfaces would go, so instead of something like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 username vrnetlab role network-admin secret sha512 $6$8zrJ4ESW2fqG2QqH$9u768TvLXXDeUJmG2Std71EX1ip6q4MoJrMwDng1cmpuSYc9ECWytRjvXpMH7C3dzSdoEv0MxAUiAZeeTre3h. ! interface Ethernet 1 description tacocat ! << SNIP >> interface Management1 We have something like this: 1 2 3 4 username vrnetlab role network-admin secret sha512 $6$8zrJ4ESW2fqG2QqH$9u768TvLXXDeUJmG2Std71EX1ip6q4MoJrMwDng1cmpuSYc9ECWytRjvXpMH7C3dzSdoEv0MxAUiAZeeTre3h. ! {{ ethernet_interfaces }} interface Management1 The substitutes we passed into the render_substituted_config method is a list of tuples, where the first item in the tuple is the variable we want to replace ( ethernet_interfaces in this case) and the second value is a regular expression that matches the section of the real running config that we want to put into this variable. Ultimately, using this example, if we had a \"real\" running configuration containing the following interface section (just using one interface to keep things simple) that looked like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 username vrnetlab role network-admin secret sha512 $6$8zrJ4ESW2fqG2QqH$9u768TvLXXDeUJmG2Std71EX1ip6q4MoJrMwDng1cmpuSYc9ECWytRjvXpMH7C3dzSdoEv0MxAUiAZeeTre3h. ! interface Ethernet 1 description tacocat ! interface Management1 Our rendered template would end up looking just like that. Again, the point of this method is to allow you to more easily do configuration replaces without having to fully template out device configs. The obvious downside to this method is that it may require fairly complicated regular expressions in order to properly slice and dice the real config. On Prepare \u00b6 The on_prepare argument of the scrapli-cfg objects gives users the opportunity to pass a callable that will be executed prior to any operations occurring (this happens during the aptly named \"prepare\" method which you should be calling prior to using scrapli_cfg operations -- note that if you use the context manager functionality this will already be called for you!). The purpose of this on_prepare callable is to... prepare a device for config operations. Initially scrapli_cfg platforms contained a sane default on_prepare function that basically just disabled console logging. The reasoning for disabling console logging is to ensure that any get_config operations don't have log messages garbling up the output. This \"sane default\" setting has since been removed as it was a bit too much \"magic\" -- meaning that it felt wrong for scrapli_cfg to be making any kind of persistent configuration changes to your devices potentially without users being aware that was happening. As such, it would be a good idea to provide an on_prepare callable to at the very least disable console logging.","title":"Basic Usage"},{"location":"user_guide/basic_usage/#basic-usage","text":"","title":"Basic Usage"},{"location":"user_guide/basic_usage/#picking-the-right-driver","text":"When using scrapli_cfg, you will need to ensure that you are building a scrapli_cfg object specific to the target device.

Just like the other methods, this method does exactly what it sounds like it would. There is one important difference between this method and the others, however; the diff_config method returns a ScrapliCfgDiffResponse object instead of a ScrapliCfgResponse object. The ScrapliCfgDiffResponse object is mostly the same as a normal scrapli_cfg response, but it also contains some properties that contain the diff output. scrapli_cfg always tries to get a diff from the device itself -- from whatever means are available on box, but also builds some basic diffs of its own. The diffs that scrapli_cfg builds are fairly simple and will show the difference between the candidate config and the target config, but will have no context about merge vs replace operations, so the diff will always show the \"full\" configuration diff (with colorful output though!). You can see each of the diffs like so: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg with open ( \"config\" , \"r\" ) as f : my_config = f . read () device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.11\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"cisco_iosxe\" } with Scrapli ( ** device ) as conn : cfg_conn = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn . prepare () load_result = cfg_conn . load_config ( config = my_config , replace = True ) print ( load_result ) diff_result = cfg_conn . diff_config () print ( diff_result . device_diff ) print ( diff_result . unified_diff ) print ( diff_result . side_by_side_diff )","title":"Diff Config"},{"location":"user_guide/basic_usage/#render-substituted-config","text":"The render_substituted_config method is used to (based on user provided regex) auto merge a candidate configuration with sections of the current device configuration. This is meant to allow users an easy-ish way to start doing config replace operations, without having to have a template that covers all aspects of the device configuration. For example, let's say you want to manage everything on a switch except the interfaces. Maybe you want to do this because managing loads of templates for all the different types of interfaces/platforms is a pain, or maybe a different team manages that part of the config... whatever the case you want to be able to do full config replaces, but leave that part of the config completely untouched. This is what the render_substitued_config method is designed to help you with. Here is an example of using this method: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 from scrapli import Scrapli from scrapli_cfg import ScrapliCfg from scrapli_cfg.platform.core.arista_eos.patterns import ETHERNET_INTERFACES with open ( \"config\" , \"r\" ) as f : my_config = f . read () device = { \"host\" : \"172.18.0.14\" , \"auth_username\" : \"vrnetlab\" , \"auth_password\" : \"VR-netlab9\" , \"auth_strict_key\" : False , \"platform\" : \"arista_eos\" } with Scrapli ( ** device ) as conn : cfg_conn = ScrapliCfg ( conn = conn ) cfg_conn . prepare () rendered_config = cfg_conn . render_substituted_config ( config_template = my_config , substitutes = [( \"ethernet_interfaces\" , ETHERNET_INTERFACES )] ) load_result = cfg_conn . load_config ( config = my_config , replace = True ) print ( load_result ) In the above example we have a fairly \"normal\" scrapli_cfg setup -- create a connection and open it. Once the connection is opened we call the render_substituted_config and we pass a config_template and a list of substitutes to it. The config template is what it sounds like -- a template (that looks like a jinja2 template). In this case, this template has a variable ethernet_interfaces in the file where the ethernet interfaces would go, so instead of something like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 username vrnetlab role network-admin secret sha512 $6$8zrJ4ESW2fqG2QqH$9u768TvLXXDeUJmG2Std71EX1ip6q4MoJrMwDng1cmpuSYc9ECWytRjvXpMH7C3dzSdoEv0MxAUiAZeeTre3h. ! interface Ethernet 1 description tacocat ! << SNIP >> interface Management1 We have something like this: 1 2 3 4 username vrnetlab role network-admin secret sha512 $6$8zrJ4ESW2fqG2QqH$9u768TvLXXDeUJmG2Std71EX1ip6q4MoJrMwDng1cmpuSYc9ECWytRjvXpMH7C3dzSdoEv0MxAUiAZeeTre3h. ! {{ ethernet_interfaces }} interface Management1 The substitutes we passed into the render_substituted_config method is a list of tuples, where the first item in the tuple is the variable we want to replace ( ethernet_interfaces in this case) and the second value is a regular expression that matches the section of the real running config that we want to put into this variable. Ultimately, using this example, if we had a \"real\" running configuration containing the following interface section (just using one interface to keep things simple) that looked like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 username vrnetlab role network-admin secret sha512 $6$8zrJ4ESW2fqG2QqH$9u768TvLXXDeUJmG2Std71EX1ip6q4MoJrMwDng1cmpuSYc9ECWytRjvXpMH7C3dzSdoEv0MxAUiAZeeTre3h. ! interface Ethernet 1 description tacocat ! interface Management1 Our rendered template would end up looking just like that. Again, the point of this method is to allow you to more easily do configuration replaces without having to fully template out device configs. The obvious downside to this method is that it may require fairly complicated regular expressions in order to properly slice and dice the real config.","title":"Render Substituted Config"},{"location":"user_guide/basic_usage/#on-prepare","text":"The on_prepare argument of the scrapli-cfg objects gives users the opportunity to pass a callable that will be executed prior to any operations occurring (this happens during the aptly named \"prepare\" method which you should be calling prior to using scrapli_cfg operations -- note that if you use the context manager functionality this will already be called for you!). The purpose of this on_prepare callable is to... prepare a device for config operations. Initially scrapli_cfg platforms contained a sane default on_prepare function that basically just disabled console logging. The reasoning for disabling console logging is to ensure that any get_config operations don't have log messages garbling up the output. This \"sane default\" setting has since been removed as it was a bit too much \"magic\" -- meaning that it felt wrong for scrapli_cfg to be making any kind of persistent configuration changes to your devices potentially without users being aware that was happening.

So its like NAPALM? \u00b6 If you are familiar with the configuration management abilities of the excellent NAPALM library then you are already generally familiar with what scrapli_cfg is capable of. The primary differences between scrapli_cfg and NAPALM are as follows: scrapli_cfg has, and never will (unless I change my mind), have \"getters\" outside the \"get_config\" and \"get_version\" getters. This means there will not be anything like \"get_interfaces\" in scrapli_cfg. scrapli_cfg has no dependency on any APIs being available -- configurations are all handled via Telnet or SSH. This may sound \"bad\" because the cli is so \"bad\", but it means that there are no requirements for additional ports to be opened or services to be enabled (i.e. eAPI or NETCONF), it even means (with a bit of work to handle initially logging into a terminal server and getting to the right port) you could use scrapli_cfg to fully manage device configuration over terminal server connections. scrapli_cfg has no Python dependencies other than scrapli -- this means there are no vendor libraries necessary, no eznc, no pyeapi, and no pyiosxr.
