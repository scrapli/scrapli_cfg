                is not open. If `True` will automatically open and close the scrapli connection when
                using with a context manager, `prepare` will open the scrapli connection (if not
                already open), and `close` will close the scrapli connection.
            ignore_version: ignore checking device version support; currently this just means that
                scrapli-cfg will not fetch the device version during the prepare phase, however this
                will (hopefully) be used in the future to limit what methods can be used against a
                target device. For example, for EOS devices we need > 4.14 to load configs; so if a
                device is encountered at 4.13 the version check would raise an exception rather than
                just failing in a potentially awkward fashion.
